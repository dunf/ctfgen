# CTF Scenario-DSL
This app generates a CTF scenario based on the input specified declaratively using a domain specific language that is designed and created as part of a Master thesis at NTNU Gj√∏vik.

### Requirements
* oyaml
* python-heatclient
* python-openstackclient
* tqdm

### Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/dunf/master-thesis.git
cd master-thesis
virtualenv3 py3-env
source py3-env/bin/activate
pip3 install oyaml
pip3 install python-heatclient
pip3 install python-openstackclient
```
### Usage
```
# Remember to source OpenStack RC file first
python3 main.py -f examples/example-attack-defense-minimal.yaml --debug --run
```

### Notes
* Until deploy key creation can be implemented properly the program is dependent on linux.
* Openstack VM images must have cloud-init
* Each node creates its own security group(s). In scenarios with many nodes we might exceed the quota limit for security groups.  
* Ansible inventory is populated with IP addresses after the heat stack is created. Sufficient time must be allocated to ensure that all nodes have aquired an IP address. DNS is probably the solution to this problem.
